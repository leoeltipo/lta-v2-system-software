# Clonning repository to work with Xilinx SDK

* Create a SDK the usual way (Export Hardware and Launch SDK).
* Create an application (Empty app) the usual way.
* Clone the repository to any location.
* Copy the contents of the directory (.git, inc/ and src/) into the newly created empty application.

Now the files are already cloned.

* In Xilinx SDK, right click on project name and Refresh.
* Add inc/ path in project settings.
* That's it. Commit, push and pull the usual way from command line.
